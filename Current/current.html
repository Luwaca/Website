                    <p>anyway i miss you so much not just having you as my girl but i miss hearing your voice and i miss being able to talk to you about whatever it is i miss waking up to your messages i miss you so much i really do love you and im honestly a little bit mad not at you just at the fact i was so close to coming to you im getting enough money now to see you multiple times a year and i was so close just like a couple months and i could come to canada to see you and i know you may have thought my anxitey would stopped me but it wouldnt have because as much i fear things, my love for you is way stronger the only thing currently keeping me sane is the hope that we can talk again.</p> 
                     <p>Also theres things happening and i actually just wish i could tell you about it like some cool things and come sad things but like the good things im kinda excited for it</p>
                        <p>and i really hope you talk to me again i dont want us to be strangers i know everything about you and you know pretty much everything about me, we have built a pretty great relationship the past 3 years.
                    Even if you don't feel the same, I want you to know I love you more than anything you are and always will be the love of my life.</p>
