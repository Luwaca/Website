Everything about us seemed to fit so perfectly, but there were issues like there are with every relationship.
                     but what i had always dreamt about was 1 of 2 things either we have have our own house and potentially eventually a kid because i do think a kid from us would be so cute but that would be further in the future but like cuddling while we watch a storm pass by or going on late midnight drives with music, or even going on random late night walks or something orrrrr watching spongebob or bobs burgers for the 1000th time while just having you in my arms being able to give you kisses and back rubs and everything you love eating snacks and drinking our favourite drinks doing everything under the sun i wanted to show you everything i possibly could like doing a bunch of things that would be so fun.
                    There are so many things I still want to show you and do with you. also i really wanna try weed edibles with you i think that would be so fun.</p>
                    <p> but then years down the line as we got older i always imagined how amazing our story would be like being able to tell our kid or if our kid had a kid then our grandkids the story of us fuck me that would be so cute and it would be so awesomee</p>
