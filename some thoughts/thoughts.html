                <a href="../New page/new page.html" style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration:none;" > <p>After you broke up with me i was down bad like hella bad, i was completely fucked just asking my self, "what did i do" "why did this happen" all those questions and it got me thinking alot about everything in the relationship from start to finish i genuinly did not want you back until i really understood what happened and then it all kinda clicked, i never knew what i did to make you feel trapped or controlled, or what could have made you feel nothing for me and i came to the realization.</p>
                    <p>That i dont think you meant that i told you, you couldnt do certain things but you felt trapped because you knew the things i didnt like and in knowing that it made you feel like if you did those things it would make you think you were a bad girlfriend or maybe even a bad person and sure i could be wrong.</p>  
                     <p>and if im being completely honest here to a degree i was sub consionsly trying to hide you from the world because i was so scared that someone else would come along and take you from me and that wasnt fair to you it was selfish of me to do that and it isnt me like really im not the insecure type,i want to post you on my social media i dont want to hide you, also people say i have an ego because of how highly i think of myself i remember when even you would call me cocky because i do think highly of myself but i realized that the way i am now is the version that matched you when i first met you i started catering alot to the younger version of you and i lost myself in the relationship  i could be wrong but maybe you were a little intimadated not like scared but because i was so confindent in the begenning which is why you were the way you were and i was the way i was but then as time went on we kinda grew in reverse like i became a bit more insecure and clingy and you grew to be more like me more confindent in yourself and less clingy which is good.</p>
                      <p>In alot of ways this break up was good for better or for worse i think it was needed for us to actually break up.</p>
                      <p>I do love you and miss you like crazy and i would love the chance for us to build something even better then what we had our last relationship was flawed and messy but with time we can build something better i honestly dont want to just instantly get you back and call you my girl again i want to do it in person i want to take you on a real date and i want to show you who i really am. which given the chance like legit i will fly to you and give you flowers and take you out on a real date like money isnt going to be an issue.</p>
                      <p>I want us to be friends, so please if you do see this and you are willing to be friends and talk to me again unblock me on insta or message me on discord or something or just like add me back on tiktok and i will know and i will reach out randomly.</p> 
                      <p>Or message my number 0473880964 or add me back on snap its still lluwacal</p>
